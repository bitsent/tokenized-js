# Tokenized-JS

An up-to-date TypeScript/JavaScript collection of protobuf classes for the Tokenized protocols.

(If the library is no longer up-to-date by the time you see it, simply run ```npm run generate``` to update to the latest official version.)

Spacial thanks to UNISOT, without whom this library wouldn't have been released.
